            <h3>Redmi Note 11</h3>
            <p>
                The Redmi Note 11, like any budget phone, is a compromise: the design, build quality, screen and battery life are great, but the rear camera quality and the overall performance are where you'll notice the savings on the price of the handset have been made. With its Redmi and Poco sub-brands, Xiaomi wants to remind us that it's not all about the top-tier flagship smartphones – and the company consistently puts out low-price handsets that give you more than you might expect for your money. We've seen it plenty of times in the past and the Redmi Note 11 is another example. Despite costing very little – around £200 in the UK – the phone comes with decent battery life, an excellent screen, and a build quality that's impressive. Picking up and using the Redmi Note 11, you wouldn't necessarily think that you'd paid so little for it, and it might make your flagship-owning friends wonder why exactly they've paid so much. The specs that the Redmi Note 11 comes with aren't quite as impressive, which is to be expected, but during our time with the phone, we didn't notice any major issues in terms of slowdowns or bugs. Whether it's watching movies, playing games, sending messages, checking social media, or browsing the web, the phone is perfectly capable and isn't going to let you down in any of these areas. Thanks to the bright AMOLED screen and the competent stereo speakers, media playback is an area where the Redmi Note 11 does really well. If you're looking for a phone that is going to cope well with YouTube, Netflix, iPlayer, and so on, then this might be exactly what you need – and at 6.43 inches, the screen hits a sweet spot between the smallest and the largest displays out there. Of course, there are shortcomings, as you would expect from a phone that costs so little. Photos and videos captured by the phone's rear camera aren't brilliant, especially as the available light goes down. A lot of the time you'll get snaps that look pretty good, but for difficult situations – moving subjects, night shots – you're going to want to think about spending more for a phone with a better camera on the back. You don't get any support for 5G here either, which is unusual for a phone nowadays, even one that costs as little as the Redmi Note 11 does. How much this matters to you will likely depend on whether there's any 5G in your area yet – after all, 4G is still pretty speedy. Overall though, if you can live with those issues, you'll find this is one of the best cheap phones available.
